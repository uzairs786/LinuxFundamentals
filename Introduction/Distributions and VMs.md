# Distributions and Virtual Machines (VMs)

- Distributions are variations or flavours of Linux
- They are suited to different tasks and needs
- Common Distributions: Ubuntu, Santos and Debian etc.
- Ubuntu is popular due to its friendliness for beginners

## Virtualisation of Linux

Linux is commonly set up and run by means of a Virtual Machine (VM). 
**Ubuntu via UTM (Mac)**
This allows for use whilst not replacing your computer's current OS
For Mac Users: Installation of Ubuntu can be done by the UTM Website

- This will allow you to access and run the Linux OS whilst not replacing the Mac OS.

**Renting a VM from AWS**
- A more common way is to launch and connect to an EC2 Instance
- EC2 Instance: a service that allows you to connect with virtual servers in the cloud
- We can therefore access and run Linux (Ubuntu) on the cloud by simply connecting with the EC2 Instance
- The Terminal can be accessed directly from your computer's terminal
