# üêö The Shell

It is the user interface that provides access to the OS Services
It is the layer between the user and the core of the OS
It translates commands and makes them executable

## Types of Shells

- BASH (Bourne Again Shell)
- Zsh
- Ksh
- Csh/Tsch
- Fish

Each shell has its own features and properties but they all serve the same purpose: **to help you interact with the OS**
Most Linux OS come with BASH as the default shell

`echo $SHELL` returns as `/bin/bash`

## Zsh Shell

- It stands out to be a powerful shell due to its features such as autocompletion, customisation and spelling corrections
