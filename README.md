# LinuxFundamentals
This repository will document my journey into learning the fundamentals of Linux. It will prove to be my own personalised guide into some of the basics of Linux such as installation of a Virtual Machine, Filesystem navigation, management, permissions and more. This will include the practical journey of the OverTheWire Bandit game from Levels 1-15
